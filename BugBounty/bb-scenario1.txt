Hello Zoom Security,

I have found the following vulnerability in your site. Here are the repro steps:

1. The attacker creates a fake account.
2. The attacker then changes the account e-mail address.
3. A change approval email is sent to the attacker with a link to approve the change.
4. Modifying the "email=" querystring parameter in the verification link allows the attacker to compromise any other users account. 

Please fix this.
